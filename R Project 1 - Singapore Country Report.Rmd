# Section 1: Country Introduction

### Map

![**Figure 1. Map of Singapore outlining the country with a scale bar.**](images/singapore_map_with_scale.gif)

Singapore is a rather unique country. As an island city-state in Southeast Asia, located off the southern tip of the Malay peninsula. Singapore is made up of 63 islands, including the main island Pulau Ujong, which are organized into the five regions seen in the map below.

![**Figure 2. Map of Singapore displaying the five urban districts. These district lines were drawn by the Ministry of National Development in Singapore in their 1991 Concept Plan.**](Introduction/Singapore Regions.jpeg)

Developed for urban planning and general administrative purposes, this five-region system allows for the country to be further divided for governance by councils and mayors. The populations and areas of these regions are denoted in the table below.

![**Figure 3. Tabulated data of the current population and area of the five urban regions of Singapore. Data has been arranged in order of current population, from least to greatest.**](images/five_regions_data.png)

### Urban vs Rural Population
The urban population of Singapore was reported at 100% from 1960 till the most recent data collected in 2020, according to the World Bank's collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources.The entirety of the country is esentially one large urban center, with all of its 5.686 million population residing in urbanized areas. Per the criteria outlined by the United Nations criteria, any town or city with 20,000 people+ living within its established boundaries is considered to be urban. Thus, in the case of Singapore, this means that 100% urbanization has been achieved under this umbrella definition. The general population of Singapore has continued to grow since 1960, as can be seen in the plot below.

### Urban vs Rural Population Density
According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Singapore is the second most densely populated country in the world, with 8,019 residents per kilometer squared, or 18,645 residents per mile squared. This can be primarily attributed to Singapore’s highly urbanized nature, with the entire country being one large urban center. 

### Climatic and Geographical Analysis
As mentioned above, Singapore is a sovereign city-state that consists of one large island (mainland Singapore or Pulao Ujong), and 62 smaller islands. Most of Singapore is flat, with more than half of mainland Singapore situated only 50 feet above sea level. Bukit Timah Hill, the highest point of Singapore at 545 feet above sea level, stands in the middle of the island. Singapore is located near the equator and has a tropical climate, with uniform temperatures, high humidity throughout the year, and abundant rainfall.


# Section 2: Demography 

### Median Age
```{r, echo=FALSE}

The median age in Singapore is currently 42.2 years, which is a considerable increase since the mid-20th century. Predictions estimate the median age to continue increasing and reach 53.4 years by 2050. 

### Infant Mortality Rate

![**Figure 6. Infant Mortality Rate in Singapore from 1950-2020. There has been an overall decrease in infant mortality rate (measured in the number of deaths in every 1,000 live births) since 1950. The decrease can be split into three general phases: 1950-1965, 1965-1990, 1990-2020.**](images/infant_mortality_1950_2020.png)

With more recent developments, especially within the realms of health and healthcare, the infant morality rate of Singapore has continually decreased since 1950. Currently, the country experiences an average of 2 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, ranking fourth in lowest rates among other countries across the globe.

### Age-Sex Pyramid

![**Figure 7. Age distribution of the Singaporean population, divided by sex. Data is based on 2019 figures as reported by https://www.populationpyramid.net.**](images/Singapore_AGE_SEX.png)



###"Jumps" in Age Structures: Contributing Events
There are a few things to consider when looking at the age structure of Singapore society.  The first major discontinuity is seen when moving from the 65-69 age range to the 70-74 age range.   Prior to this category, there had been a steady decline in the population numbers.  Yet, this is where that decline drops much more significantly and in a way that looks different between male and female populations.  Women’s age structure seems to decline in a much more consistent way, showing a sharp decline, but one that is much steadier compared to the male population.  Men in this age range see a much more significant drop in population, suggesting that women tend to live longer on average compared to their male counterparts given social and biological factors that contribute to lifespan differences between the sexes.  Moreover, the population structure shows a significant portion of the population is within the 20-24 to 60-64 age range, with the highest being 45-49 for women and 55-59 for men in Singapore. This is interesting for a few reasons.  First, the high numbers of those between 20 and 40 years old reflect social policy moves that were made in Singapore in the 1980s.  After years of a two-child policy within the country to help curb population growth after World War II, Singapore had reversed its policy approach in the 1980s (BBC, 2021).  During this period, the country actually encouraged citizens to have bigger families to increase the size of the shrinking population.  Thus, the largest age categories tend to fit around this period, with the exception of the highest population group of men being 50-59.
